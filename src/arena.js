// # Arenas - Where Games are Played

// An `Arena` consists of a 2-player `game` played by all agents, and an
// undirected `graph` representing the neighborhoods of each agent, i.e. which
// pairs of agents can play each other.
const Arena = function(game, graph) {
    // The `graph` must be non-empty, i.e. must have at least one node.
    if (graph.order() === 0) {
        throw new RangeError('graph is empty');

    // The `graph` may not have any disconnected agents, i.e. everyone must
    // have someone to play with.
    } else if (Array.from(graph.degree().values()).includes(0)) {
        throw new RangeError('graph has a disconnected node');
    }

    //
    // There are a few things that an `Arena` needs to be able to do. The
    // prototype of the object provides this functionality.

        // _**`size()`**_

        // First of all, we need to be able to get the `size` of the `Arena`,
        // i.e. the number of agents. This is particularly useful for
        // allocating arrays and error checking.
        size() {
            return this.graph.order();
        },

        // ********************************************************************
        // _**`payoffs(ss)`**_

        // Next, we need to be able to determine the counterfactual `payoffs`
        // that each player could have recieved given all of the agents'
        // previous strategies `ss`.
        payoffs(ss) {
            // The strategies `ss` must be an array. If that's not the case, we
            // throw a `TypeError`.
            if (!Array.isArray(ss)) {
                throw new TypeError(`strategies must be an array, got ${ss}`);

            // We also need to make sure the array is the right size, namely
            // that each agent has a strategy, and we throw a `RangeError` if
            // that's not true.
            } else if (ss.length !== this.size()) {
                const msg = 'strategies must have same size as arena';

                throw new RangeError(`${msg}; ${res}`);
            }

            // We then create a `size() x 2` matrix of `payoffs` where the
            // `[i][s]` element corresponds to the total pay off the `i`th
            // agent would have recieved had they played strategy `s` in the
            // previous round of games.
            //
            // This amounts to looping over each of the agents, then each of
            // that agent's neighbors, and then the possible strategies the
            // agent could have played. Within this looping structure, we
            // accumulate the payoff for each such combination.
            const size = this.size();
            const payoffs = new Array(size);

                for (let j of this.graph.neighbors(i)) {
                    for (let s = 0; s < 2; ++s) {
                        payoffs[i][s] += this.game.getPayoff(s, ss[j]);

            }

    // ## Object Creation
    //
    // The resulting object uses the above prototype, and exposes the `game`
    // and `graph` to the user as enumerable members.
    return Object.assign(Object.create(proto), { game, graph });
